known issues:

the api used to get match data does not provide the summoner spell ids of bots
macro input of special chars
considering trimming down on the cooldown menus, which are automatically generated at runtime
sometimes the center icon of the radial menu/cursor ddoesnt load. just reload the overlay in the settings  window

to fix: 

add minimize to tray
add mouse button/game controller support
different menu sets for different maps and modes
