LoL Iris Communicator

known issues:

This code is clunky, hideous... need professionals or more experienced amateurs to clean up.

the api used to get match data does not provide the summoner spell ids of bots

macro input of special chars does not work with the curent library for generating key events

considering trimming down on the cooldown menus, which are automatically generated at runtime

sometimes the center icon of the radial menu/cursor ddoesnt load. just reload the overlay in the settings  window

to fix: 

add mouse button/game controller support

different menu sets for different maps and modes
