LoL Iris Communicator

Known issues:

This code is clunky, hideous... need help with cleanup.

The api used to get match data does not provide the summoner spell ids of bots.

Macro input of special chars does not work with the curent library for generating key events.

Considering trimming down on the cooldown menus, which are automatically generated at runtime.

Sometimes the center icon of the radial menu/cursor ddoesnt load. just reload the overlay in the settings window.

There are missing ability icons, etc. If you make note, they can easily be added in.

To Fix:

Add mouse button/game controller support

Different menu sets for different maps and modes

~Add Zilean Icons
